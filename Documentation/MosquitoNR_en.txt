[Description]

    MosquitoNR is a noise reduction filter designed for mosquito noise, which is
  often caused by lossy compression such as MPEG. This filter works as follows:

  1. Compute low frequency components of the image.
  2. Apply direction-aware blur (smoothing). This blur effectively reduces
     compression artifacts, but also breaks detail.
  3. Restore the low frequency components to the blurred image.

    MosquitoNR processes only luma. If you want to process chroma too, you can
  write script like following, but there might be no noticeable change.

  |  MosquitoNR()
  |  u = UtoY().MosquitoNR()  # In AviSynth 2.6, UtoY8() may be faster
  |  v = VtoY().MosquitoNR()
  |  YtoUV(u, v, last)


[Parameters]

  Syntax: MosquitoNR([clip,] int strength, int restore, int radius, int threads)

  - strength (range: 0-32, default: 16)
      Sets the strength of the blur. Setting this value higher brings stronger
    noise reduction effect, but side effect will also become stronger.

  - restore (range: 0-128, default: 128)
      Sets the rate of restoring. If set to 0, no restoring is performed. If set
    to 128, low frequency components of the blurred image is completely replaced
    with those of the original image, and runs slightly faster.

  - radius (range: 1-2, default: 2)
      Sets the radius of the blur. 1 is faster, but will have insufficient
    effect in some cases.

  - threads (range: 0-32, default: 0)
      Controls how many threads are used. By default, threads is set equal to
    automatically detected number of processors. Since this filter needs a lot
    of memory access, thread efficiency is not very good. Setting this value
    lower might improve overall processing speed.


[Requirements]

  - AviSynth 2.5.8 or later
  - CPU with SSE2 support
  - Supported color formats: YUY2, YV12, YV16, YV24, YV411, Y8
  - Progressive only


[Acknowledgments]

    This filter is a combination of flash3kyuu's AviUtl plugin "smoothing filter"
  and nilpo's AviUtl plugin "low frequency components protection filter", and
  this combination was proposed by POP@4bit. I thank all of them very much.
